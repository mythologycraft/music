# Music

[toc]

## What is this?

Here you can find the custom written music for the MythologyCraft Minecraft server and the projects for said music! 

### What can you find in here?

In this repository you'll be able to find a couple of things:

- The music in different formats
- The stems for the music
- The midi files (where possible, a lot of samples are used)
- The Ableton Live project file (we use Ableton Live 10)

### Why is it here?

We believe that we could be more than a Minecraft server, we believe that we can also publish (a part of) custom made content. Apart from that, we also believe that we can do this as open-source as possible. That is because we took from the community and we want to give it back!
