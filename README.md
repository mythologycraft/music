# Music

[toc]

## What is this?

Here you can find the custom written music for the MythologyCraft Minecraft server and the projects for said music! 

### What can you find in here?

In this repository you'll be able to find a couple of things:

- The music in different formats
- The stems for the music
- The midi files (where possible, a lot of samples are used)
- The Ableton Live project file (we use Ableton Live 10)

### Why is it here?

We believe that we could be more than a Minecraft server, we believe that we can also publish (a part of) custom made content. Apart from that, we also believe that we can do this as open-source as possible. That is because we took from the community and we want to give it back!

## Licensing
Although we want to give back to the community, writing a complete soundtrack is quite time consuming and it costs money (the virtual instruments are very expensive), therefor we would like you to credit us if you do use our music!

The music is/will be published under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. You can read more about it [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0 "CC BY-SA 3.0 Licencse").

Please do note that everything about the license may not be 100% accurate! Please check the website that is linked!

### You are free to:
- **Share:** Redistribute the material, this includes uses like: including this music in your video's.
- **Adapt:** Remix, transform and build upon this music, even commercially.

### Under the following terms:

- **Attribution:** You must give appropriate credit. Also indicate if you've modified this material.
- **ShareAlike:** This essentially means that if you adapt (*see above*) and you publish it, you *must* do so under the same license.

### How to give appropriate credit

There are two cases: if you're using an unmodified version and if you're using a modified version.

Because we do understand that this can be difficult and/or confusing, we've provided you with ready-to-use templates!
The two templates showed underneath are examples, the song specific templates (the one you should use) are in the same folder as the piece itself!

#### Unmodified version

In this case you must give credit. This *must* include the following things:

- Name of creator and attribution parties
- Link to the piece
- Indication that the piece is available Public License.

Here's an example:

```
Music:
{name of piece} by {name of author} written for MythologyCraft Minecraft server: {link to piece}. This is licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
```

Please note that you can 'stack' all of the credits *from our music*!
Here's an example

```
Music
{name of piece 1} by {name of author} written for MythologyCraft Minecraft server: {link to piece}. This is licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
{name of piece 2} by {name of author} written for MythologyCraft Minecraft server: {link to piece}. This is licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
```

#### Modified version

If you've modified a piece and want to publish it, it's not problem! But of course you have to credit us.

It's almost the same as above, but you have to state one more thing: the thing you changed! This can be quite short as: 'A remix of:' or something similar.
Here's an example:

```
Music:
This is {the thing you changed} of{name of piece} by {name of author} written for MythologyCraft Minecraft server: {link to piece}. This is licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
```

If it doesn't make a good sentence just swap the words around a little, that is no problem! And of course you can stack them just like above!
